After Effects CC 2014 (Windows) keyboard shorcuts modified for better use with Danish keyboard

All shortcuts using Brackets '[', ']', and tilde '~' are not working on Danish keyboards, so I've replaced them with 'æ', 'ø' and '½'. E.g. Trimming a layer in the timeline is now done using 'ALT' + 'Æ' / 'ALT' + 'Ø'. I have also addded 'AltGr' + 'Æ' / 'AltGr' + 'Ø' since it is a lot easier to reach with one hand.
Danish key '^¨~' (next to Return key - code Ux00A8) replaces the parts in English shortcuts using '=' (equal sign). E.g. zooming on the timeline.
