After Effects CC 2014 keyboard shorcuts modified for Windows with Danish keyboard

All shortcuts using Brackets '[', ']', and tilde '~' are not working on Danish keyboards, so I've replaced them with 'æ', 'ø' and '½'. E.g. Trimming a layer in the timeline is done using ALT + Æ / Ø. I have also addded AltGr + Æ / Ø since it is easier to reach single handed.
Danish key '^¨~' (next to Return key - code Ux00A8) replaces the parts in English shortcuts using '=' (equal sign). E.g. zooming on the timeline.
